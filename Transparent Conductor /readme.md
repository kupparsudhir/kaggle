https://www.kaggle.com/c/nomad2018-predict-transparent-conductors

The diffrent properties of Aluminum,Gallium,Indium is given in data set. In order to reduce electric transmission loss,discovery of new transparent conductor alloy is important. The transparent conductor having characteristic good conductivity and have a low absorption.

The aim is to prediction of two target properties: the formation energy (which is an indication of the stability of a new material) and the bandgap energy (which is an indication of the potential for transparency over the visible range) to facilitate the discovery of new transparent conductors

# Data set
train,test,geomeric property data set are provided by the host.
The task for this competition is to predict two target properties:

    Formation energy (an important indicator of the stability of a material)
    Bandgap energy (an important property for optoelectronic applications)
