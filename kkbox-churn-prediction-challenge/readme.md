In this competition youâ€™re tasked to build an algorithm that predicts whether a user will churn after their subscription expires.

## Data set
Submissions are now evaluated on the mean column-wise ROC AUC. In other words, the score is the average of the individual AUCs of each predicted column.

## Evaluvation metrics
The evaluation metric for this competition is Log Loss

## Feature engineering
Some descriptive statistic features and one hot encoding on categorical variables are added.

## Model
Intial analysis is made using logistic regression, later gradient boosting methods are used to build model. The model is evaluated using 5 fold cross validation stragergy.

## Out come of project
This project help to analysze property of atoms using exploratory data analysis.
